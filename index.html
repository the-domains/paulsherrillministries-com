ministry of A. A. Allen, Paul had a life-changing encounter with an angel who
appeared to him and walked home with him. As Paul turned to go into his house,
the angel disappeared before his eyes. Not knowing what it all meant at the
time, Paul went to his room where his brother laid dying of a rare and
incurable kidney disease. As Paul kneeled down and began to pray for his brother,
God miraculously healed him and gave him two new kidneys. This creative miracle
was the beginning of a life that would be filled with miracles, signs and
wonders. Paul then made Deliverance Evangelistic Center his church home where
Apostle Arturo Skinner was the Pastor and overseer.</p></div></div></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-black colors-global " data-reactid="34"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="35"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="36"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="37"><span data-reactid="38"><!-- react-empty: 39 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="40"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="41">Paul Sherrill Global Ministries</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="42"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="43"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="44"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
