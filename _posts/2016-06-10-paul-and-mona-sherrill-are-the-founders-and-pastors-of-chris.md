Paul and Mona Sherrill are the Founders and Pastors of Christ Revealed Miracle Tabernacle located in Mitchellville, Maryland. In 28 years of ministry, they have ministered in more than 28 nations on four continents. Through North American and International Schools of Ministry, Conferences, World Mission Training Centers, and Healing Schools, Paul has equipped thousands of five-fold ministers and church leaders to reach and impact their generation. Paul has conducted Miracle Rallies and Mass Miracle Crusades where multitudes have experienced mighty signs, wonders, miracles and healing. Apostle Sherrill also participated in the Billion Soul Crusade with Dr. Morris Cerullo in the decade of the 90's. Paul has currently launched "Operation Vocal Glory" to prepare the Body of Christ worldwide for the end-time harvest.

The beginning: One September night in 1970, after being introduced to the
ministry of A. A. Allen, Paul had a life-changing encounter with an angel who
appeared to him and walked home with him. As Paul turned to go into his house,
the angel disappeared before his eyes. Not knowing what it all meant at the
time, Paul went to his room where his brother laid dying of a rare and
incurable kidney disease. As Paul kneeled down and began to pray for his brother,
God miraculously healed him and gave him two new kidneys. This creative miracle
was the beginning of a life that would be filled with miracles, signs and
wonders. Paul then made Deliverance Evangelistic Center his church home where
Apostle Arturo Skinner was the Pastor and overseer.

February 1987: Jesus appeared to Paul in an open vision and commissioned him
to take His gospel and His healing power to the nations of the world. Jesus
began to show Paul His plan for his life and how that He would use him to
strengthen nations by equipping His people to walk in the supernatural power of
God. Jesus then told Paul in the vision to go to Tulsa, Oklahoma and there He
would show him what he should do next.

One night while in Tulsa at a Dave Roberson meeting, Dave ministered to Paul
and confirmed the call of God on his life through a word of prophecy. From that
time forward, Paul devoted his life to preparing for ministry under the
teaching ministry of Dave Roberson.

Four years later: In 1991, Morris Cerullo welcomed Paul to his team as an
Associate Minister where Paul ministered on behalf of Morris Cerullo World
Evangelism in Africa, South America, Asia and the Caribbean conducting Schools
of Ministry and Miracle Crusades just as Jesus told him during the visitation
in 1987\. God has now commissioned Paul to take what He has taught him to the
nations and raise up others to do the same. Paul contributes much of his
success in ministry to his "Papa" Morris Cerullo who provided vital
training and instruction.

Currently: Under the leadership of Paul and his wife Mona Sherrill, God has
led them to set up an Apostolic Power Base in the DMV. It is from there that a
generation of reformers are being raised up in a Supernatural School of
Ministry Church (Christ Revealed Miracle Tabernacle) to impact their
generation. Apostolic Teams are being equipped and dispatched to the nations of
the world as God leads. Dr. Randy Clark of Global Awakening is covering Paul
and Mona through the Apostolic Network of Global Awakening.

Paul and Mona have been married for 24 years. They have five children and
seven grandchildren.
